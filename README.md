# BOLT
*Lattice Boltzmann Simulator*

### **Compilation Instructions:**
From within the ```BOLT``` directory enter the command:

```g++ --std=c++11 src/*```

This will generate an output file: ```a.out```

**Running the Simulator:** 

```./a.out```

### **Future Plans:**
The next major step for this project is the inclusion of *Immersed Boundary Conditions* in order to allow for simulation of flow around objects within the channel - adding real value to the simulator.
